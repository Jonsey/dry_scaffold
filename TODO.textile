h1. TODO

h2. Next

* Idea: _actions:*,hello => all default actions including "hello"-action
* Something like "model_generator_with_factories" (using machinist, factory_girl, ...). Source: http://github.com/vigetlabs/model_generator_with_factories/tree/master
* Break up in different generators: dry_controller, dry_views, etc., and use as dependencies in dry_scaffold
* Optionally generate builders (Atom/RSS/...)

h2. Maybe later

* Comment the code a bit more =)
* Check for overridden templates in: RAILS_ROOT/lib/dry_scaffold/templates/
