h1. TODO

h2. Next

* Feature: Generate Atom/RSS builder stubs for formats - if specified - atom/rss for index action. (Reference: http://gatezero.org/~tim/2008/04/22/generating-valid-atom-feeds-from-rails-202/)
* Feature: If route is already declared in config/routes.rb, then don't generate it.

h2. Maybe later

* Clean-up: Comment the code a bit more =)
* Refactor: Break up in different generators: dry_controller, dry_views, etc., and use as dependencies in dry_scaffold?
* Feature: Check for overridden templates in: RAILS_ROOT/lib/dry_scaffold/templates/
