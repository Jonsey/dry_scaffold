h2. Most probably

* Something like "model_generator_with_factories" (using machinist, factory_girl, ...). Source: http://github.com/vigetlabs/model_generator_with_factories/tree/master

* Optionally generate builders (Atom/RSS/...)

h2. Maybe

* Check for overridden templates in: RAILS_ROOT/lib/dry_scaffold/templates/
