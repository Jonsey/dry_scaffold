h1. TODO

h2. Next

* Feature: Handle belongs_to, i.e. specify MODEL --belongs-to PARENT_MODEL, which generates proper routes, proper before-filters if inherited_resources-controller, adding belongs_to-association in model, and correct form_for arguments.
* Choose test suits: testunit/shoulda/rspec

h2. Maybe later

* Clean-up: Comment the code a bit more =)
* Refactor: Break up in different generators: dry_controller, dry_views, etc., and use as dependencies in dry_scaffold?
* Feature: Check for overridden templates in: RAILS_ROOT/lib/dry_scaffold/templates/
* Feature: Builder for podcast-feed, similar to RSS/Atom-builders.
